# Crazyflie Control using MPC

This is a relatively simple repo which allows for control of a quadrotor using OpEN, a library for extremely fast model predictive control.
It allows for real-time MPC through a network, with their lab demonstration showing a quadrotor solving an obstacle avoidance problem in real time.
Instead of even a relatively complex task of that magnitude this repo simply demonstrates control of the Crazyflie quadrotor that can be run on a typical machine and allow for fast, optimal solutions to be solved on a ground station which sends these inputs to the Crazyflie.
